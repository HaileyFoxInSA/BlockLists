A lot of lists contain unverified / dead domains, and are not organized. These lists are all verified by me. Either by going to the domain or by using automated tools that I've written.

These domains are a mix that other users have compiled and ones that I have found. I manage a computer repair shop, and I am able to see which domains are being reached by the computers that come in.

These lists are free to use.
