A lot of lists contain unverified / dead domains, and are not organized. These lists are all verified by me. Either by going to the domain or by using automated tools that I've written.

These are domains are a mix of domains that other users have compiled and ones that I have found. I manage a computer repair shop and able to see what domains infected systems are trying to reach.

These lists are free to use.
