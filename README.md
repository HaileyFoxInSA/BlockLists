A lot of lists contain unverified / dead domains, and are not organized. These lists are all verified by me. Either by going to the domain or by using automated tools that I've written.

These domains are a mix that other users have compiled and ones that I have found. I manage a computer repair shop and able to see what domains infected systems are trying to reach.

These lists are free to use.
